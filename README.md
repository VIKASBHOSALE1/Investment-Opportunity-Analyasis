# Investment-Opportunity-Analyasis
This project, titled "Investment Opportunity Analysis," is designed to provide investors with data-driven insights to optimize their portfolio management strategies. By analyzing historical stock data from various companies, the project aims to evaluate investment performance by comparing individual stock returns and risks against overall market trends.
The project employs advanced data processing and analytical tools, including PySpark for large-scale data manipulation, Apache Hive for data storage and querying, and Apache Airflow for workflow automation. Grafana is used to create visualizations, such as performance charts and candlestick charts, which help in understanding complex data patterns and trends.
One of the key aspects of the project is its focus on portfolio diversification. By calculating the correlation between different stocks and their respective risks, the project constructs portfolios that minimize risk while maximizing returns. This approach is supported by daily automated data fetching and analysis, ensuring that the information remains current and relevant.
Overall, this project provides a robust framework for investors to make informed decisions, with tools and visualizations that enhance the understanding of market behavior and investment performance.
